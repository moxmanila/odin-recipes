            <p>This tasty omelette is a favorite signature dish of mine. Tested 
                by many years of trial and error I've found the perfect recipe for
                the omelette that I like to eat every morning. Feel free to experiment
                by adding different toppings to the omelette.

            <p> Cut the onions and garlic finely and fry them with butterin a wide pan until brown. Into a bowl
                whisk the eggs and add a pinch of salt and pepper. Add the eggs and let it cook for 
                two minutes. When the outer side becomes solid, add your grated parmegiano on top and 
                fold the omlette in half. After that you can leave it in the pan as long or as short as
                you like. If you want the insides more runny, I suggest leaving it in for max. 30 seconds.
